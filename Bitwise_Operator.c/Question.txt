You need to find the maximum values of bitwise AND, OR, and XOR for numbers a and b (where a < b), ensuring that each result is less than a given threshold k.

Input:
Two integers: n (the highest number to consider) and k (the maximum value for the result).
Output:
Print the maximum values for AND, OR, and XOR, each on a separate line.
